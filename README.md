## Problem Statement üöß

Everyone benefits from exercise and physical activity. Staying active can benefit you in a variety of ways, regardless of your health or physical abilities. In reality, research shows that ‚Äútaking it easy‚Äù is dangerous. When older adults lose their ability to perform activities on their own, inactivity is often to fault rather than aging. Lack of physical activity can also contribute to additional doctor visits, hospitalizations, and medication use for a range of conditions. This idea of a personal AI fitness trainer allows more people to get involved in the fitness field. Using this AI trainer makes sure everyone can perform exercises in the correct way, minimizing the risk of injuries. Then using the appropriate body part angles, the count of exercise is determined. We will be using ERAI, a personal fitness tracker bot; this will have unique features which we might add during the hackathon.

## Background üìñ

 
## About Our Product üîß

### What
In our project, we will be developing a web application for live fitness tracking. Various methods have been proposed in order to detect different postures of a human being. Posture analysis also plays an essential role in the field of medicine such as finding out the sleeping posture of a patient. Image processing using openCV and mediapipe python library for human posture estimation. Image processing based approach helps to analyze postures such as standing and sitting postures. Fitness exercises are exceptionally beneficial to individual health, but they can also be ineffectual and quite possibly harmful if performed incorrectly. When someone does not use the proper posture, exercise mistakes may occur. This proposed application utilizes pose estimation and detects the user‚Äôs exercise posture and provides detailed, customized recommendations on how the user can improve their posture. A pose estimation module in python called mediapipe helps to detect all major joints of the human body. Then it calculates the angle between the joints and increases the counter for each repetition. Pose estimation is a method in which spatial locations of key body joints are calculated using an image or video of the person. This computer vision technique detects human posture in videos and shows the key points such as elbow or shoulder in the output video.

### Why

 With TrainERAI, we aim at providing a simple interface so users from all age groups can use it, and can be aware about the situation. Our Product, TrainERAI comes to aid as it enables individuals to workout anywhere and anytime. We provide simple and minimal UI/UX in a small storage space as we provide a simple WebView of our Web App in a React Native Application.

We have been planning to add a bot which guides users in all aspects, it can even give an alert as well as a success message for each and every movement of the user for each exercise. We can also include voice assistance for the next movement and any wrong posture is detected by the model. It can also monitor your exercises to help you keep count of your exercise repetitions performed, but also alerts you when you have an incorrect posture or have not performed a full repetition. A visualization chart depicting your performance throughout the exercise will be displayed when you end the program. 

It can be really useful in any pandemic situation like COVID, due to the unfortunate position of isolation, people are struggling with various health-related problems such as obesity, irregular sleep patterns, eye strain, mental stress, decreased immunity, and hence, are at a higher risk of getting infected with the Coronavirus. The impact of staying fit is huge and it helps to be sane with all the stress people have. Now as the gyms are closed and people don't have the required guidance, an alternative is needed. In this pursuit of adapting to modern norms, a solution with gamified concepts is needed to help people with their fitness routine and keep them motivated to exercise daily.

This eliminates the need for any trainer or expert‚Äôs intervention to know the correct technique for performing yogasanas and rectifying them. You just need your laptop which has a webcam to run this awesome application! The massive library of poses makes it perfect for everyone, be it beginners or professionals. This application can also calculate the calories burned during each exercise, and display it on the screen. It will be a live calorie tracker and may differ for each individual. We can also implement boxing training in this application as well, that is different targets will be displayed on the screen and users are asked to hit at the correct point, to score and accordingly till a target is reached, thereby it ensures if the users posture and angle is correct. Also we can implement zumba training in the same way as above, by having a target goal each day motivates users to be consistent. 

Introducing diet plans would be one of our future scopes of our project idea. This can be achieved if the personnel is undergoing a diet andhe/shewants to only consume a certain amount of calories and then the app will display a three course meal, consisting of breakfast, lunch and dinner providing all the macros and micronutrients for the person. This can also include food recipes if the person wishes to cook his meals. This will be helpful for people who is really conscious regarding their physique and living style.

Also adding a BMI calculator will also help the person track his/her body fat percentage and he/she can work on his progress with the help of ERAI.
